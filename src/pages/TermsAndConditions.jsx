                    1. These terms apply to all offers, quotations, agreements,
                    services, and acts. In case of conflict between the contents
                    of the agreement and these general terms, the provisions of
                    the agreement prevail.

                <h3> The Agreement </h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    he agreement is concluded when the customer accepts Zebrano
                    Studio’s offer. The purchase is established upon signing the
                    order confirmation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    2. The order confirmation is leading in principle. The
                    customer must carefully check it for omissions and
                    inaccuracies and report these to Zebrano Studio in time, at
                    least within 3 days of receipt of the order confirmation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3. Offers and promotions are temporary. After the closing
                    date of an offer or promotional period, the customer can no
                    longer make use of it. Price reductions after the agreement
                    is concluded—for example due to offers, promotions, or
                    discounts on showroom models—do not entitle the customer to
                    a price reduction.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    4. Special promotional terms may apply to offers and
                    promotions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    5. Amendments to the agreement and deviations from these
                    general terms are only valid if agreed in writing between
                    the customer and Zebrano Studio.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    6. If changes to the agreement lead to an increase or
                    decrease in costs, the resulting change in the purchase
                    price must be agreed in writing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    7. If it appears that (further) performance of the agreement
                    by Zebrano Studio is not possible due to force majeure,
                    Zebrano Studio may suspend or dissolve the agreement without
                    being liable for damages. This does not prevent the parties
                    from making mutual proposals to amend the agreement in such
                    a way that proper and complete performance is possible.

                  <li>
                    8. In the event of the customer’s bankruptcy, suspension of
                    payments, or attachment of assets, Zebrano Studio may
                    dissolve the agreement in whole or in part without notice of
                    default.

                  <li>
                    2. If the customer wishes to terminate the agreement without
                    a breach having occurred and Zebrano Studio agrees, the
                    agreement may be terminated by mutual consent. In that case,
                    Zebrano Studio is entitled to compensation for damage,
                    including loss suffered and lost profit. Unless agreed
                    otherwise, the compensation amounts to 30% of the purchase
                    price, or 50% if at the time of termination by mutual
                    consent the customer has already been informed that
                    (partial) delivery can take place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3. If Zebrano Studio collects the product from the consumer
                    at the consumer’s request, the consumer bears the costs.
                    These are <em>€95.00 including VAT</em> for addresses within
                    the Benelux. At the time of collection, the product must be
                    properly packaged and ready behind the first threshold. If
                    not, the product will not be taken.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    4. The purchase amount will be refunded after Zebrano Studio
                    has inspected the product and found it to be complete,
                    unused, and undamaged.

                  <li>
                    5. If the customer wishes to arrange a (removal) lift or
                    crane themselves, Zebrano Studio will deliver the products{" "}
                    <b>free of charge</b> on the ground floor without assembly.
                    The customer remains responsible for moving and/or
                    transporting products via the lift or crane, loading and
                    unloading the products, and assembling them, as well as for
                    any damage resulting therefrom.

                  <li>
                    6. If the delivery location is not accessible at the time of
                    delivery—for example because the product dimensions are too
                    large to reach that place—this is at the customer’s expense
                    and risk. In that case Zebrano Studio will deliver the
                    products <b>unassembled</b> on the ground floor.

                  <li>
                    7. If the products offered for delivery are not accepted,
                    other than due to defective delivery, Zebrano Studio will
                    make a second delivery within a reasonable period.

                  <li>
                    8. If it appears upon delivery by Zebrano Studio that
                    immediate delivery cannot take place due to circumstances
                    for the customer’s account and risk as described in this
                    article, and the customer requests a second delivery,Zebrano
                    Studio may charge additional freight, delivery, and storage
                    costs to the customer.

                  <li>
                    9. If the customer wishes to postpone the delivery date,
                    this must be communicated to Zebrano Studio no later than{" "}
                    <b>20 working</b> days prior to the scheduled delivery date.
                    A later request will be assessed for feasibility and storage
                    costs will be charged to the customer. Storage costs are{" "}
                    <b>€25 per week</b> from the original delivery date. For
                    changes within <b>3 working days</b> prior to the scheduled
                    delivery date, we charge <b>€75</b> change fees to the

                    purchase price. For agreements with a business customer,
                    Zebrano Studio may, before delivering or continuing

                    4. If Zebrano Studio performs a delivery under an agreement
                    in parts, it is entitled to demand payment for each partial
                    delivery. The customer will receive a partial invoice for

                  <li>
                    5. The consumer owes statutory interest pursuant to{" "}

                    in which they are in default of paying the purchase price.

                    7. Zebrano Studio is entitled to proceed to collection of
                    the amount due without further notice of default and may
                    engage third parties for collection. In that case, the

                    which is reasonably proportionate to the nature and

                  <li>
                    2. For custom-made products, minor deviations in dimensions
                    are permitted. Zebrano Studio may deviate by <b>2%</b> from
                    the agreed dimensions, unless expressly agreed otherwise.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3. The customer must in all cases give Zebrano Studio the
                    opportunity to remedy any defect. Zebrano Studio’s liability
                    is limited to <b>repair free of charge</b> of a defective
                    product or <b>replacement</b> of that product or a part
                    thereof, at Zebrano Studio’s discretion.

                  <li>
                    4. No warranty is given if defects are the result of normal
                    wear and tear, improper use, lack of or incorrect
                    maintenance or installation, (dis)assembly, modification, or
                    repair by the customer or third parties. No warranty is
                    given on products that were not new at the time of delivery,
                    showroom models, products or parts covered by a
                    manufacturer’s warranty, or product-specific characteristics
                    including the natural behaviour of wood (see also below).

                  <li>
                    5. All wooden parts are subject to a <b>limited warranty</b>
                    covering manufacturing defects only. The{" "}
                    <b>natural behaviour of wood</b> is excluded as it is not a
                    defect in the product or production but a characteristic of
                    the material. “Behaviour of wood” includes expansion,
                    shrinkage, cracking, and/or warping. The wood used by
                    Zebrano Studio is sawn and dried to a moisture content of
                    approximately <b> 8%–12%,</b> making the product suitable
                    for use in a heated room. Wood remains a natural product and
                    absorbs/releases moisture. The extent to which this occurs
                    depends, among other things, on temperature differences and
                    humidity. Wood will work less if the humidity remains at a
                    near-constant level; we recommend <b>50%–60%</b> humidity,
                    typically <b>10% lower in winter</b> and{" "}
                    <b>10% higher in summer</b>.

                    purchase, the customer applies the associated care products
                    to the product themselves. This is not performed by Zebrano

                    4. If the customer installs, assembles, etc., products

                    and/or third party is responsible for correct installation,
