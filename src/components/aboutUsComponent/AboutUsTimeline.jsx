Amidst the bustling markets and serene temples, something caught our eye: everywhere we looked, we saw the most amazing handcrafted wooden items. From small figurines to impressive furniture â€“ the attention to detail and the natural beauty of the wood were truly captivating. It was like a lightbulb went off: "Wow, this is it! We have to do something with this!"</p>

We started small, with super cool exclusive wooden bookmarks and unique tapas boards. But soon our projects became more ambitious: how about handcrafted beach paddles made from special wood types like the striped Zebrano, the deep red Purpleheart, or the exotic Palm wood? Each piece of wood had its own story and unique grain, and we loved making them speak.</p>

A place where we could wander among the most beautiful planks and find inspiration. And then came the moment: new doors were needed. Buy them? No way! We could do that much better ourselves, right? And so it happened: in 2020, our very first self-made door saw the light of day. Crafted from Zebrano, our absolute favorite wood type. That distinctive grain and beautiful aesthetic... we were instantly sold!</p>

People were just as enthusiastic as we were about the unique beauty and quality. It was clear: we had to do more with this.
